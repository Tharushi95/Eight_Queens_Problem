# Eight_Queens_Problem

I have used the Hill Climbing method to solve this problem.
In the original code namely EightQueens.java the queens are randomly placed avoiding the attacks with each other queens horizontally, vertically and diagonally.
But in the second approach namely EightQueensProblem.java the best possible solutions are obtained through iterating the loops so that either global maximum or the local maximum is occurred due to the randomly selected positions.
